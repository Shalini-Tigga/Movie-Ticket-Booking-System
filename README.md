# Abstract
This project report presents the development and implementation of a Movie Ticket Booking System, created by Desai Shanmuka Sainath Reddy, Shalini Tigga, Ms. Kirti Singh, and B. Vinu Kanth. The system is designed to provide users with a convenient platform for booking movie tickets online. Key functionalities include user registration, browsing available movies, booking tickets, secure payment processing, and ticket cancellations. Developed using the C programming language, the project employs foundational concepts like loops and switch cases to ensure a reliable and intuitive user interface. Additional features include real-time updates on movie screenings and integration with local theatres. Future enhancements aim to incorporate more payment options and improve system compatibility. This system demonstrates how digital tools can transform traditional booking processes, prioritizing efficiency and user satisfaction.
